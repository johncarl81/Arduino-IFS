##About
Arduino-IFS is an Iterated Function System Fractal generator for the Arduino Micro-controller. This code runs on the open source Arduino UNO (and compatible) micro-controller with the RGB 65k color LCD shield (links below) from NKC Electronics.

Iterated Function Systems sit on the simple end of the Fractal spectrum.  IFS fractals produce beautiful images mimicking patterns seen all around us in nature and natural phenomenon.  They are generated by making probability based vector transformations in a recursive / iterative manner.

This project started as an effort to learn how to program a basic micro-controller.  I was astonished by how easy the Arduino is to program and get some real results from.  After finding the LCD shield on Amazon.com I knew I could generate IFS fractals on the Arduino.

The code is a combination of the Arduino C-style language and C++.  Most of the IFS generation code (iterating, translating, drawing) is contained in the C++ library classes.

I am always interested in collaboration, so please contact me if you have any questions or ideas.

##Instructions
First, you must assemble the LCD shield for the Arduino ([LCD Shield Assembly](http://mcukits.com/2010/11/27/rgb-lcd-shield-for-arduino-65k-color-v2-kit-assembly-guide/)).  I found soldering the PCB between the LCD and shield to be the most difficult part.

To install the Arduino-IFS project, download the source by cloning the repository.  Move the IFS library directory into the Arduino library folder ($ARDUINO_HOME/library).  Next, open the ifs.pde file in the Arduino IDE.  Compile and install onto the prepared Arduino with the LCD shield attached.  This should produce the Dragon IFS fractal.  To generate other factals redefine the affine pointer as follows:

    double* affine = spiralaffine;

Compile and deploy will generate the spiral IFS fractal (pictured below).
